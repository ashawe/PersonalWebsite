        <h3>👋 Hi, I'm Harsh</h3>
        <h5 style="margin-top: 0">
          I am an tech hobbyist, cybersecurity enthusiast and a digital
          content creator.
        </h5>
        <p>
          My goal is to develop new and innovative technologies / solutions in
          the automation and technological industries through my combined
          software and hardware experience. <br />I am looking forward to do
          research in the field of cybersecurity and cryptography.
          <br />Additionally, I am a hobbyist 🎮
          <a class="blog-category pink" target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ashawe57/">gamer</a>, 🎸
          guitarist, 📖
          <a class="blog-category pink" target="_blank" href="https://goodreads.com/ashawe">reader</a>, writer, 🎨
          sketch artist and have been sharing my stories on 📷
          <a class="blog-category pink" target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/ashstudios">YouTube</a>
          since 2016. I created this site to share my interests, as they
          evolve, and connect with like minded individuals.
        </p>

        <h3>👨‍💻 My journey as a developer</h3>
        <h5 style="margin-top: 0">
          My main interests include Web Development and App Development.
        </h5>
        <p>
          I have always been interested in coding as I was overwhelmed by
          technology. Being a tech savvy from an early age, I always wanted to
          study Computers and the tech related to it.
          <br />I've been coding since I was 14, exploring markup languages
          like HTML and low level programming language like C.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later I joined a Diploma Program ( in 2015 ) and then got admitted
          in an Engineering College to persue Computer Engineering ( in 2018
          ). Both of these educational institues helped me in developing my
          programming and technical skills.<br />
          Along this journey, I learned various computer programming and
          development languages like: C++, Core & Advanced Java, VB, VB.NET,
          ASP.NET, DBMS, Networking and OS concepts ( in college ), Android,
          PHP ( through internship )HTML5, CSS3 ( and Bootstrap ), JS ( and
          JQUERY ), Git, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premier Pro, Unity, Blender
          While in college I also won various web development compitions.<br />
          I continued to develop various individual and group projects. You
          can check them out on my Github profile
          <a class="blog-category pink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ashawe/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>🔐 My interest in CYBERSECURITY</h3>
        <p>
          My Interest in cybersecurity grew when I was exploring hacking and
          stumbled upon CTFs. CTF - Capture The Flag - are games / compitions
          which test your programming, technical, networking as well as
          computer skills. Since then I've participated as well as organised
          various CTFs. Following my interests I co-authored a research paper on Network Intrusion Detection Systems and
          how they can be implemented with Google's Federeated Machine Learning model to improve upon privacy concerns
          when it comes to datasets in cybersecurity.<br />
          After completing various cybersecurity related courses, my interest kept growing and I decided to persue
          masters in Cybersecurity at University of Maryland, College Park. Here, I met fellow cybersecurity
          enthusiasts, participated in more CTFs, started studying for CompTia Pentest+ and gave a workshop on
          "Introduction to Cryptography".

        <h3>🤔 Other things about me</h3>
        <p>
          When I'm not doing dev stuff, <br />
          I love to play some <b>games</b>! My favorite online multiplayer is
          <s>CSGO</s> Valorant. ( Add me on <a class="blog-category pink" target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ashawe57/">steam</a> or FL4SH#100 on Riot Games
          ).<br />
          I <b>read</b> books!. You can checkout the book I'm currently
          reading
          <a class="blog-category pink" target="_blank" href="https://goodreads.com/ashawe">here</a><br />
          Sometimes I just pick up my 🎸 <b>Guitar</b> and start jamming on
          songs I love! <br />
          If I feel like it, sometimes I make 📷 <b><a class="blog-category pink" target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/ashstudios">youtube</a></b> videos. (Although, I've currently taken a break but I get a craving for making youtube videos now and then.)<br />
          If you can't find me anywhere, I'm either on a badminton court, gym
          or the terrace 😉<br />
