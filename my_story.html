            since 2016. I created this site to share my interests, as they
            evolve, and connect with like minded individuals.
          </p>

          <h3>👨‍💻 My journey as a developer</h3>
          <h5 style="margin-top: 0">
            My main interests include Web Development and App Development.
          </h5>
          <p>
            I have always been interested in coding as I was overwhelmed by
            technology. Being a tech savvy from an early age, I always wanted to
            study Computers and the tech related to it.
            <br />I've been coding since I was 14, exploring markup languages
            like HTML and low level programming language like C.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later I joined a Diploma Program ( in 2015 ) and then got admitted
            in an Engineering College to persue Computer Engineering ( in 2018
            ). Both of these educational institues helped me in developing my
            programming and technical skills.<br />
            Along this journey, I learned various computer programming and
            development languages like: C++, Core & Advanced Java, VB, VB.NET,
            ASP.NET, DBMS, Networking and OS concepts ( in college ), Android,
            PHP ( through internship )HTML5, CSS3 ( and Bootstrap ), JS ( and
            JQUERY ), Git, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premier Pro, Unity, Blender
            While in college I also won various web development compitions.<br />
            I continued to develop various individual and group projects. You
            can check them out on my Github profile

          <h3>🔐 My interest in CYBERSECURITY</h3>
          <p>
            My Interest in cybersecurity grew when I was exploring hacking and
            stumbled upon CTFs. CTF - Capture The Flag - are games / compitions
            which test your programming, technical, networking as well as
            computer skills. Since then I've participated as well as organised
            various CTFs.<br />
            I have also completed various cybersecurity courses and I'm working
            on two research papers.
